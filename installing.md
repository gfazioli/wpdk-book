# Installing

To start developing with *WPDK framework*, first of all you have to install WPDK in your WordPress environment.
Please follow these simple rules to accomplish this task.

1. Verify the system requirements:
  * Wordpress 3.4 or higher (last stable version is highly suggested) - **Note: WordPress MU is not yet supported.**
  * PHP version 5.2.4 or greater
  * MySQL version 5.0 or greater
  * We suggest to update your browser always at its last version, because WPDK uses *javascript* language to accomplish some tasks.

2. Download the zip of WPDK framework from official GitHub repository [clicking here](https://github.com/wpXtreme/wpdk/tree/production).
This is the official stable (production) branch of the framework. If you want to download the framework from other branches
of this repo, please remember that *their source code is still experimental*, and then it is not ready to be used in any
production environment.

3. Unzip the framework. You will have its root directory named `wpdk-production`

4. Copy the entire `wpdk-production` folder in the `wp-content/plugins` directory of your WordPress environment.

Done. WPDK framework is installed in your environment.

**Please note that you won't see WPDK framework in your WordPress plugins dashboard, because WPDK does not need to be
activated. Once installed, WPDK is immediately ready and available.**
